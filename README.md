<p>The links opener is an outlook add-in that allows you to open hyperlinks&nbsp;from inside email messages with any of currently installed browsers including non-default browsers</p>
<p>Currently MS Outlook supports opening of links using the default browser</p>
<p>Nowdays we are&nbsp;using 2-3 browsers to perform our daily tasks and using outlook as our email client creates a required connection between it and installed browsers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The add-in automatically recognizes the installed browsers and creates a context menu that will appear only when used on a link</p>
<p>You can open urls from emails recieved or while&nbsp;editing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small remark regarding a trust issue - due to budget limitations I used a certiifcate generated locally on my dev machine, meaning its not recognized as a trusted publisher certificate and outlook will a security alert message</p>
